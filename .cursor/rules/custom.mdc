For image shapes we assume as given:

image: (H, W, C)
grayscale image: (H, W, 1)
images: (N, H, W, C)
grayscale images: (N, H, W, 1)
volume: (D, H, W, C)
grayscale volume: (D, H, W, 1)
volumes: (N, D, H, W, C)
grayscale volumes: (N, D, H, W, 1)

i.e, we always know as given:

num_channels = shape[-1]
width = shape[-2]
height = shape[-3]

---
WE DO NOT EXPECT:

grayscale image with shape: (H, W)
graysclae volume with shape: (D, H, W)
etc

There is always channel given, even if it is 1.
